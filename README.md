## Implementation
- To implement form validation using JavaScript, follow these steps:

- Attach event listeners to form fields or form submission events.
- Write JavaScript functions to validate each form field as per the specified criteria.
- Display error messages if the validation fails.
- Prevent the form from being submitted until all fields are valid.
- Optionally, provide feedback to users in real-time as they interact with the form (e.g., showing a strength meter for password input).
## Usage
- To use form validation in your web application, include the necessary JavaScript code for form validation in your HTML file.
- Attach event listeners to form fields or form submission events, and write validation functions for each form field to check the input against the specified criteria.
-  Display error messages or highlight invalid fields if the validation fails. Prevent form submission if any field fails validation.
